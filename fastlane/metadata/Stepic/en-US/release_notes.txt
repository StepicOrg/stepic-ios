Hi!
In the new version of the Stepik iOS app we:
• Completely changed colors. Welcome, the new bright Stepik!
• Redesigned auth
• Changed navigation - now downloads are available from Profile.
• Fixed a bug, when Code Challenge was laggy and toolbar did not appear when it needed to.
• Fixed multiple bugs and improved stability

Enjoy learning,
Stepik team
