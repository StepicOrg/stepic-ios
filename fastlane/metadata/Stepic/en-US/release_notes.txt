In the new version of the Stepik iOS app we:
• Changed home screen and tab bar. The great redesign continues!
• Seriously improved stability
• Improved navigation between sections
• Improved fullscreen mode in Code Challenge - now it scrolls when keyboard is on the screen
• Also added HTML support to Profile, just to have it supported

Enjoy learning,
Stepik team
