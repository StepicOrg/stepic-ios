This adaptive course can be used for preparation to the Data Sufficiency section of the GMAT test. Each problem consists of a question and two statements, labeled (1) and (2), in which certain data are given. You have to decide whether the data given in the statements are sufficient for answering the question. Using the data given in the statements, plus your knowledge of mathematics and everyday facts, you must indicate whether:

A. Statement (1) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not sufficient to answer the question asked.
B. Statement (2) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (1) alone is not sufficient to answer the question asked.
C. BOTH statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are sufficient to answer the question asked, but NEITHER statement ALONE is sufficient to answer the question asked.
D. EACH statement ALONE is sufficient to answer the question asked.
E. Statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are NOT sufficient to answer the question asked, and additional data specific to the problem are needed.

Note that it is not necessary to solve the problem. It is enough to answer the question on data sufficiency.

Learning in the app is really simple! If the problem seems too difficult or too easy, you can just swipe the card with the question, the engine will take into account the knowledge level for future content recommendations.

Enjoy learning and have fun!
